Apple Magic Mouse & Keyboard Windows Support Driver (Enhanced Skeleton)
=======================================================================

STATUS: Still non-functional for end users. Added:
- Ring buffer capture of raw HID input reports (filter driver skeleton)
- Basic parsing stub for mouse report
- New IOCTL (PARSE_LAST) to retrieve structured parsed data
- Optional Virtual HID Framework (VHF) stubs (compile with ENABLE_VHF) for future Precision Touchpad style injection

What Was Added (Optional Tasks)
------------------------------
1. Driver parsing scaffolding (Magic_ParseMouseReport)
2. Additional IOCTL (IOCTL_APPLE_MAGIC_PARSE_LAST)
3. Optional VHF miniport scaffolding (Magic_VhfInitialize / Magic_VhfPostMouseGesture)
4. Data structures for parsed contacts (placeholder)

Remaining Work Before Real Functionality
---------------------------------------
Driver Layer:
- Correctly locate HID read report buffer (current illustrative access may differ; use WdfRequestRetrieveOutputMemory / map MDL as needed)
- Implement full Magic Mouse report descriptor reverse engineered layout (model specific differences) and parse contacts & gestures
- Implement Magic Keyboard Fn layer: capture vendor usages, modify output to present correct F1..F12 vs media decision
- Battery level feature report / BLE characteristic bridging (user-mode)
- Robust error handling and synchronization; IRQL correctness for ring ops (spin lock OK, ensure nonpaged memory)
- Add proper HID Report Descriptor augmentation only if creating a virtual function (avoid altering physical descriptor unexpectedly)

User-Mode Service (Not Yet Implemented)
--------------------------------------
Responsibilities:
- Open device interface (GUID_DEVINTERFACE_APPLE_MAGIC_RAW)
- Asynchronous overlapped loop: issue IOCTL_APPLE_MAGIC_PARSE_LAST (or raw) at a poll interval or convert to event-driven (read requests queued via custom queue)
- Gesture recognition state machine (track multi-finger transitions, distances, timing)
- Mapping gestures to Windows actions: either
  a) Inject pointer/mouse wheel events (SendInput / InjectMouseInput)
  b) Use VHF virtual precision touchpad for native Windows gestures (preferred)
- Fn/media key policy configuration (persisted JSON)
- Battery polling via Windows.Devices.Bluetooth for BLE devices
- Logging & diagnostics channel

Virtual HID (Precision Touchpad Emulation)
-----------------------------------------
Current stub uses an ultra-minimal placeholder descriptor. For real multi-touch/precision gestures, craft a HID descriptor matching Windows Precision Touchpad requirements (see Microsoft documentation) with collections for contacts, confidence, tip switch, contact count, etc. Feed parsed contacts through VhfReadReportSubmit at frame cadence.

Security & Stability Considerations
-----------------------------------
- Validate report lengths strictly
- Avoid trusting device-provided contact counts beyond allocated maximum
- Graceful fallback: on parser failure, still provide raw movement via unmodified lower stack pass-through
- Consider enabling WPP tracing for diagnostics (TRACE_LOGGING)
- HLK / WHQL test matrix for HIDClass filter

Build Notes
-----------
You must create a Visual Studio KMDF Driver project (Visual Studio + WDK) and add the files under src/driver. Define ENABLE_VHF in project settings only after adding VHF library/link settings.

Compilation Flags Suggested
---------------------------
- Warning level /WX
- Static analysis (/analyze) for driver
- SAL annotations for public functions

Future Enhancements
-------------------
- Configurable gesture mappings (JSON loaded by service)
- UI app (WPF/WinUI) for preferences & updates
- Auto firmware version detection & advisory
- Power management optimizations (suspend/resume re-init logic)
