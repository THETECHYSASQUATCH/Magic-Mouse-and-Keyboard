Apple Magic Mouse & Keyboard Windows Support Driver (Enhanced Skeleton)
=======================================================================

STATUS: Still non-functional for end users. Added:
- Ring buffer capture of raw HID input reports (filter driver skeleton)
- Basic parsing stub for mouse report
- New IOCTL (PARSE_LAST) to retrieve structured parsed data
- Optional Virtual HID Framework (VHF) stubs (compile with ENABLE_VHF) for future Precision Touchpad style injection
- Solution & KMDF driver project scaffolding (AppleMagicFilter.sln / AppleMagicFilter.vcxproj)
- Shared user-mode header (shared/AppleMagicIoctl.h)
- User-mode service scaffold directory (usersvc/) README

What Was Added (Optional Tasks)
------------------------------
1. Driver parsing scaffolding (Magic_ParseMouseReport)
2. Additional IOCTL (IOCTL_APPLE_MAGIC_PARSE_LAST)
3. Optional VHF miniport scaffolding (Magic_VhfInitialize / Magic_VhfPostMouseGesture)
4. Data structures for parsed contacts (placeholder)
5. Visual Studio solution & KMDF project file
6. Shared header & user-mode service folder scaffold

Remaining Work Before Real Functionality
---------------------------------------
Driver Layer:
- Correctly locate HID read report buffer (current illustrative access may differ; use WdfRequestRetrieveOutputMemory / map MDL as needed)
- Implement full Magic Mouse report descriptor reverse engineered layout (model specific differences) and parse contacts & gestures
- Implement Magic Keyboard Fn layer: capture vendor usages, modify output to present correct F1..F12 vs media decision
- Battery level feature report / BLE characteristic bridging (user-mode)
- Robust error handling and synchronization; IRQL correctness for ring ops (spin lock OK, ensure nonpaged memory)
- Add proper HID Report Descriptor augmentation only if creating a virtual function (avoid altering physical descriptor unexpectedly)

User-Mode Service (Scaffold Only)
---------------------------------
Responsibilities:
- Open device interface (GUID_DEVINTERFACE_APPLE_MAGIC_RAW)
- Asynchronous overlapped loop: issue IOCTL_APPLE_MAGIC_PARSE_LAST (or raw) at a poll interval or event-driven design
- Gesture recognition state machine (multi-finger transitions, distances, timing)
- Mapping gestures to Windows actions (SendInput vs VHF precision injection)
- Fn/media key policy configuration (persisted JSON)
- Battery polling via Windows.Devices.Bluetooth (BLE characteristics)
- Logging & diagnostics channel

Virtual HID (Precision Touchpad Emulation)
-----------------------------------------
Current stub uses a minimal placeholder descriptor. For real precision touchpad support supply Microsoft-compliant descriptor (contacts, tip switch, confidence, contact count, logical/physical ranges). Feed parsed contacts via VhfReadReportSubmit.

Security & Stability Considerations
-----------------------------------
- Validate report lengths strictly
- Clamp contact counts to MAGIC_MAX_CONTACTS
- Fail-safe pass-through on parser errors
- Consider WPP tracing (add .tmh) for diagnostics
- HLK / WHQL test matrix for HIDClass filter

Build Notes
-----------
Open AppleMagicFilter.sln in VS with WDK installed. Adjust:
- WindowsTargetPlatformVersion in AppleMagicFilter.vcxproj to your SDK
- KMDF version (KMDF_VERSION_MINOR) to installed version
Define ENABLE_VHF only after adding VHF libs (vhfkm.lib path) or remove the macro.

Compilation Flags Suggested
---------------------------
- /WX /W4
- /analyze (Driver) static analysis
- SAL annotations for public APIs

Future Enhancements
-------------------
- Configurable gesture mappings (JSON) + GUI
- Firmware version detection
- Power management optimizations (selective suspend)
- Keyboard layout customization & per-app profiles
